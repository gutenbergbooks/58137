<span class="f75">HOW TO LEARN TO PLAY.</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> is often asked the best method of learning to play.
I fancy that the best way, could one often adopt it, would
be to let a marker, as in a tennis-court, hit the balls
gently to the beginner, pointing out to him his mistakes,
so that he might not acquire a bad style. If he begins
by going on to the lawn and playing a game, his only
object will be to get the balls over the net, and he will
be almost sure to fall into bad habits of play. This is,
however, the most amusing way to learn, and will probably
always be the one in general use. If the novice
does adopt it, let him at least watch good players whenever
he can, not with any idea of trying their severe
volleys, &amp;c., but in order to see the position of the
feet and of the racket in play. When he has learned
to play fairly well, he should still watch good players
at every opportunity; but what he then needs to study
is the position in the court where they stand; when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
they go forward and when back, and what balls they
volley instead of playing off the ground. He will, in
this way, get some idea of the form which he should try
to acquire. Mr. E. L. Williams, in a recent article in
the <cite>Lawn-Tennis Magazine</cite>, advises playing against a
wall, and I believe in the benefit obtained from this
sort of practice. In fact, I have often advised players
to try it. Any sort of a wall will do; the wall of a
room, if there is nothing better. Hit the ball quietly
up against the wall, wait till it has bounded and is
just beginning to fall, then hit it as nearly as possible
in the same place. Always make a short step
forward as you hit, with the left foot in a forehanded
stroke, and with the right in a backhanded one. Try
to hold the racket properly (see <a href="#Page_10">page 10</a>), and do not
hit with a stiff arm. The shoulder, elbow, and wrist
ought all to be left free, and not held rigid. As soon as
you can hit the ball up a few times forehanded, try the
same thing backhanded, and when you are reasonably
sure of your stroke, take every ball alternately fore and
backhanded. This will give you equal practice in both
strokes, and will also force you to place the ball each
time. Add now a line over which the ball must go; in
a room a table or bureau will do very well, and, if possible,
mark out a small square in which the ball shall
strike. This may sound very childish to a beginner, but
I am sure that very valuable practice can be got in this
way, and I have spent a great many hours in a room at
this occupation. After a time you should volley every
ball, first on one side and then on the other. Then half-volley,
and after that try all the different combinations:
volley forehanded, and half-volley backhanded, &amp;c.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Always stick to some definite plan, as in that way you
get practice in placing. There is another stroke that
can well be learned in this way. Hit the ball up against
the wall so that it will strike the ground on your left
and go completely by you, then step across and backward
with your right foot, swing on the left foot till
your back is towards the wall, and try to return the ball
by a snap of your wrist. With practice, you will manage
to return a ball that has bounded five or six feet beyond
you. Try also the same stroke on the forehand side.
You can get in this way alone more practice in handling
a racket, and in making the eye and hand work
together, than you are likely to get in ten times the
length of time out of doors. Ask some friend, who really
knows, to tell you if you hold your racket in the right way,
and to point out to you any faults of style that you may
have. It is of the greatest importance not to handicap
yourself at the start by acquiring bad form. Good form
is simply the making of the stroke in the best way, so
as to get the greatest effect with the least exertion.
While nothing can be more graceful than good form, no
one should make it his chief object to play gracefully;
the result will only be to make him look absurd.</p>

<p>When you begin to play games, do not try all the
strokes that you see made. Begin by playing quietly
in the back of the court. Try simply to get the ball
over the net, and to place to one side or the other, and
to do this in good form, <i>i.e.</i>, to hold the racket properly,
and to carry yourself in the right way. As you improve
you can increase the speed of your strokes, and can
play closer to the side-lines. Remember that a volleying
game is harder to play, and you should learn to play well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
off the ground before trying anything else. Above all
things, never half-volley. If you can return the ball in
no other way, let it go and lose the stroke. This may
sound absurd, but I feel sure that most young players
lose more by habitually trying to take half-volleys when
there is no need of it, than they gain by any that they
may make. It is a stroke that should never be used if
it is possible to avoid it. If you make up your mind to
let the ball go unless you can play it in some other way,
you will thus learn to avoid wanting to half-volley.
When you become a really good player, you can add this
stroke to your others, and you will not have got into the
habit of using it too often. It is a mistake to play long
at a time. For real practice three sets a day are quite
enough. When practising for matches, you can play the
best of five sets three times a week. Almost all players
play too much, and by the middle of the season
many of them are stale. Always try to play with
some one better than yourself, and take enough odds to
make him work to win. In the same way give all the
odds that you can.</p>

<p>Remember, while playing, certain general principles.
Don’t “fix” yourself. Keep the knees a little bent, and
your weight thrown forward and on both feet, so that
you can start in any direction. If the feet are parallel
it is impossible to start quickly. Always keep moving,
even if you do not intend to go anywhere. Play quietly
and steadily without any flourish, and try to win every
stroke. A great many players seem unable to keep
steadily at work, and play a careless or slashing stroke
every now and then. This is a great mistake, and one
often loses a great deal by it. Try to acquire a habit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
playing hard all the time. The racket should be carried
in both hands, for, if you let it hang down, more time
will be needed to get it across your body. Never cut
nor twist a ball except in service; it tends to make the
ball travel more slowly, and will deceive nobody. The
underhand stroke puts a little twist on the ball, but it is
an over twist and not a side one. Try to meet the ball
fairly, <i>i.e.</i>, to bring the racket against it in the line of its
flight; or, in other words, don’t hit across the ball.</p>

<p>Watch carefully your own weak points. Any good
player ought to be able to show them to you, and you
should then try to improve your game where it is weak.
If you practise carefully and your only object is to learn,
there is no reason why you should not get into the second
class. To be among the very best players requires
physical advantages, as well as a stout heart and great
interest in the game. One is often advised to pretend to
put a ball in one place and then to put it in another.
I can assure you that it does not pay. Too many
strokes are lost by it. Exactly the same thing is true
about pretending to go to one side and then coming back
again. One is apt to get off one’s balance in making such
a feint, and it is quite hard enough to get into position for
a ball without having to start the wrong way first.</p>

<p>It is well to observe the rules carefully in practice, or
else they may distract one’s attention in a match. This
is especially true of the service. Frequently foot-faulting
in a match spoils your service altogether. In practice
you should always see that the net is at the
right height, and should always use good balls. It is
bad practice, and is also very unsatisfactory, to play with
bad balls. When the weather is too bad to use good
balls it is too bad to play at all.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="f75">THE COURT AND IMPLEMENTS OF THE GAME.</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> court is 78 ft. long. It is 27 ft. wide for the single
game, and 36 ft. for the double game. At most club-grounds
a measuring-chain is used to mark out the
court, but for a private court a chain is seldom at hand.
The easiest way to mark out a court without a chain is
to use two long measures. Select the place for the net;
then measure 36 ft. across; at each end put in a peg,
and over each peg slip the ring of a measure. On one
measure take 39 ft., and on the other 53 ft. ¾ in.; pull
both taut, and the place where the two ends meet will be
one corner of the court. Put in a peg at 21 ft. from the
net for the end of the service-line. Next transpose
the measures and repeat the same process. This will
give the other corner of the court, and at 21 ft. will be
the other end of the service-line, and one half of your
court is ready. Take exactly the same measures on the
other side of the net, and the measurement of your court
is complete. The side-lines of the single court are made
by marking off 4 ft. 6 in. from each end of the base-lines,
and running lines parallel to the side-lines of the double
court from one base-line to the other. Everything necessary
is thus found except the central-line, which runs from
the middle of one service-line to the middle of the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
The posts of the net stand 3 ft. outside of the side-lines.
If the court is intended for double play only, the
inner side-lines need not be carried farther from the net
than the service-lines. If a single court only is to be
marked out, the diagonal is about 47 ft. 5 in., instead
of 53 ft. ¾ in.</p>

<p><i>Net.</i>—The net should be bound along the top with
heavy white cotton or duck, to the depth of two or
three inches. Without this binding it is very difficult
to see the top of the net in a bad light. The most
important points in a net are that the meshes should be
too small to allow a ball to pass through them, and that
the twine should not be so large as to obstruct the view
of the opposite court.</p>

<p><i>Shoes.</i>—There is little to say about shoes, although
one’s comfort depends a great deal on them. They
should be a little too large, with the toes square or
round, but never pointed. Those made of buckskin, with
leather straps over the toes, are the most comfortable.
For the soles no rubber compares with steel points—<i>i.e.</i>,
small nails about five-eighths of an inch long, driven
into the sole of the shoe, and protruding from it about
one-quarter to three-eighths of an inch. Points injure
the ground less than rubber, as to a great degree they
prevent slipping. For gravel or asphalt the best soles
are made of very soft red rubber, which lasts a long
time and is very easy to the feet.</p>

<p><i>Balls.</i>—Ayres’s balls are used at every tournament of
importance in England, and, while this is the case, it is
necessary for tournament players to practise with them,
though those of some other manufacturers are quite as
good for ordinary play.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Rackets.</i>—The choice of a racket is an important
matter, and it is also a difficult one. Young players
seem to take pleasure in selecting the most extraordinary
rackets in a shop. Let me strongly
advise them to avoid all unusual handles, heads, or
methods of stringing. All these eccentricities are useless
at the best. Nothing is so good as the simplest form of
racket, possessing an octagonal handle, and strung in the
usual way. Such a racket is used by all the better match-players
in England. Opinions differ as to what the exact
size of the head should be, but it is certain that there is
nothing to be gained by having it square or triangular.
Again, the edges of the rim should not be bevelled. It
only weakens the frame, while it does not increase the
size of the playing face of a racket in the smallest
degree. A ball must be hit almost exactly in the centre
of the racket to make a stroke at all, for, if hit so
near the edge that the bevelled rim can affect it, it cannot
possibly go any distance.</p>

<p>As regards the proper weight of a racket, 14½ oz. is
heavy enough for any one. I know of only two of the
well-known players who use heavier rackets than this.
I should advise any one learning to play to get a
racket of 14¼ oz., and he can afterwards get one of 14½
oz. should he feel that his first one is too light. There
can be no question that a light racket can be more
easily brought round than a heavy one, and is more
easily controlled in every way. On the other hand, a
racket must have wood enough in the frame to make it
perfectly unyielding when striking a ball, and must be
heavy enough to give an effective stroke. These conditions
are fulfilled in a racket of 14¼ to 14½ oz.; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
lighter one loses something in power, and a heavier one
is unmanageable for most men. One meets from time
to time a player with a racket of 15 or 15½ oz., who
shows it with pride, and explains that his wrist is so
strong that he requires an unusual racket. As a matter
of fact, such a player seldom uses his wrist at all, but
rather he should be thankful for the advantage that
a good wrist gives him, instead of handicapping himself
by using an absurdly heavy racket. Almost more
important than the weight of the racket is its balance.
By balance is meant the way in which a racket hangs
in the hand. Many rackets of 14 oz. feel as heavy as
others of 14½ oz. There is only one way of judging the
balance, and that is by holding the racket by the end of
the handle, as if in actual play, and trying how it comes
up, and if it feels light or heavy. If it comes up heavily,
discard it at once and try another. Should it feel light
and easily managed, weigh it yourself, no matter whether
the weight is stamped on it or not. It may be that it
felt well balanced only because it was too light for use;
but should it be found to weigh 14¼—14½ oz., the balance
of it must be good. You should look carefully at the
workmanship and see that the wood is free from knots
and cracks. The grain should run evenly round the
whole frame. Look especially at the parts of the hoop,
just above the centre-piece, for there it is that a racket
usually breaks. See also that the wedge is quite
firm. Choose a racket in which the wood is left in the
natural state, as varnish, &amp;c., is often used to conceal
a flaw.</p>

<p>A racket should be very nearly, if not quite, straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
For myself, I prefer one with a very slight bend to one
side, but I can give no reason for doing so.</p>

<p>No player should have a racket that he cannot hold
absolutely stiff from the very end of the handle. It is
essential that a racket should be light enough for him
to volley with it at the very end of his reach without any
yielding in his wrist. If his wrist is not strong enough
to stand this strain with a racket of the usual weight, it
is better for him to use a lighter one. Though losing
something in the severity of his strokes, he will gain
enough in sureness to more than make up for it.</p>

<p><i>How to hold the Racket</i>—One finds many different
ways of holding the racket among good players, and no
exact rule has ever been received as correct. Still,
nearly all good players observe certain principles in
holding a racket. It is of the first importance that you
should be able to play a ball either fore- or back-handed
without changing your hold on the racket. If the hold is
changed, there is always danger of not getting the
racket into the right position quickly enough. Such a
change must require a certain amount of time and
attention, which cannot well be spared in sharp play.
The method that I should recommend is as follows:—Lay
the racket on a table with the smooth side up.
Open the hand with the thumb nearly at right angles
to the fingers, and then clasp the handle in such a way
as to make its upper right edge (or what would be its
right edge if it were cut square) fit into the hollow of the
joint between the thumb and forefinger. In closing the
fingers on the handle, do not put them directly round it,
but with the first joint of each finger slanting up the
handle, which will cause the top joints to slant down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
other way. The first two fingers should be a little
separated from the other fingers, and from each other.
The end of the handle should be well within the hand,
with the little finger round the leather rim. The thumb
should not go round on to the ends of the fingers, but
should slope upwards across the upper side of the
handle.</p>

<span class="f75">SERVICE.</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are many ways in which the service can be
delivered, but there is only one in general use. This is
the common overhand service delivered from above the
right shoulder, with or without twist on the ball.</p>

<p>To serve it, throw the ball up above the head as
nearly as possible to the height at which it is to be
struck, and strike it as it pauses before falling. Be
careful to throw the ball well back and about on a line
with the ear. If it is thrown forward the service will
probably go into the net. In serving, the arm should be
extended to almost its full length, so as to get the
greatest possible reach, and the shoulder should be left
free and not held stiff. When serving for speed only,
the face of the racket should be brought fairly against
the ball with no twist whatever, and the head of the
racket should be made to come over on the top of the
ball by a sharp bend of the wrist. When trying to
put twist on the service, the racket should not meet the
ball fairly, but should pass round on the outside of it;
this will give a twist from right to left.</p>

<p>A very uncommon and difficult service can be given
by throwing up the ball a little to the left of one’s head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and carrying the racket round on the left hand side of
the ball, which will give a twist from left to right. It is
possible to put a heavy spin on the ball in this way, and
the service is effective, because it is very uncommon.</p>

<p>The next most important service is the underhand
twist service delivered either fore- or back-handed. To
begin with the former, the player should stand with the
feet near together and his weight on the right foot.
The racket should be held nearly vertical and just to
the side of the right leg. The ball is dropped outside,
and a little in front of, the racket, which is brought
forward against the ball, and thus, by a quick inside
turn of the wrist imparts a strong twist to it. In
striking, the weight is thrown forward on to the left foot,
and a short step forward with that foot is made to give
pace to the service. The service should not be delivered
with a jerk, but by a quiet easy swing; the only really
quick motion being the turn of the racket round the ball
which gives the twist.</p>

<p>The backhanded underhand service is precisely similar,
but is made on the left side with the right foot forward.
The ball is struck with the rough side of the racket, and
of course breaks from left to right.</p>

<p>There is only one other service that need be mentioned.
The arm is at right angles to the body, with
the elbow slightly bent, and with the head of the racket
a little higher than the wrist. The ball should be struck
at the height of the shoulder, and the racket, after
striking the ball behind and a little on top, should open
and pass forward beneath it so as to impart pure cut
to the ball. The ball does not rise as much as with
most services, and is often returned into the net when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the service is first tried. It is, however, useful only as
a change service, or to increase the chance of the ball’s
shooting, on a wet ground.</p>

<p>It should be distinctly understood that, in giving
any service, the weight of the body must be thrown
forward at the time of striking; otherwise no great speed
can be obtained.</p>

<p>As the rule now requires the front foot to be on the
base-line when the ball is served, it is better to put the
toe on the line before serving. The weight of the body
is held a little back, and is then thrown forward as the
ball is struck. It is not so easy to serve fast in this way
as it is by taking a step forward, but, on the other hand,
one seldom or never serves a foot fault.</p>

<p>Players too often forget the importance of placing the
service. It is very hard to make a good first stroke off
a well-placed service, even if it be a slow one. It is
also important to conceal the direction of the service as
long as possible, so that one’s opponent may not know
in which corner of the court to expect it.</p>

<p>Having described the different kinds of service, we
have next to consider which of them should be used.
The best working service is probably the simple overhand
service delivered without twist. It should be
placed down the central-line or across to the outer
corner of the court, and should be served as fast as possible.
Should the first service be a fault, it is the custom
to serve again in the same way, but at such a pace that
there will be no danger of a second fault. We are often
told that a good player should cultivate a second service
which should be difficult to return, and at the same
time should never be a fault. I can only say that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
is easier said than done, as no one has yet succeeded in
carrying it out. Again we are told that if a player cannot
serve a good second service, he would do better not to try
a very hard service the first time, but to serve a medium-paced
service which would be at once reasonably sure of
going into court, and yet be difficult to place on returning.
I must dissent entirely from this advice. I believe that
in the single game and with good players the service is
a distinct disadvantage. The first service is oftener a
fault than not, and the second service can be placed
almost as the striker-out pleases. Why not then serve
a medium service the first time? Because no service,
not even the very slow second service, can be placed so
sharply and accurately as a moderately fast one. It is not
fast enough to place the striker-out at a disadvantage,
and yet it comes back more quickly in the return than
a slower one would do, and therefore leaves the server
less time to get into position for the first return.
Another difference, often overlooked, is, that a player
must “fix” himself to a certain extent to deliver a service
of even medium speed. He cannot, therefore, get into
position as quickly after a fairly fast service as after a
slow one, and yet he will be given less time to do so.
Of course, he “fixes” himself for the first very fast service,
but, in this case, he expects to gain a distinct advantage
should his service be good. Off such a service it is
very difficult to make a good first stroke, and the server
will probably have a chance to come forward and finish
the rest with a volley.</p>

<p>My own feeling is that the server must start at a disadvantage
unless he can deliver a severe first service.
In any other case he must be content to stay back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
even outside his court, while his opponent is forward,
and his object for the time must be rather to save the
rest<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> than to win it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Or “rally” as it is sometimes improperly termed.</p></div>

<p>For a second service the forehanded underhand twist
is useful, especially when served into the left court. It is
not in itself difficult to return, but it keeps low, and
will often twist a little more or a little less than the
striker-out expects, thus preventing him from making a
severe first stroke.</p>

<p>It sometimes pays to place such a service as near
as possible to the outer corner of the court, and to follow
it up almost to the net. One would think that there
would be no difficulty in passing the server as he comes
forward, but it requires a very accurate first stroke to
do so. If the stroke is not well-placed, there will be a
chance for a sharp volley which should win the rest. It
needs great quickness to make such a volley, and no one
should take such a risk unless he can volley really well.
In trying such a coup as this, he must take into account
what his chance of winning the rest will be if he gives
an easy second service and stays back. If he finds that
he has been losing twice out of three times on his second
service, it is well worth while to try going up, especially
as it is very annoying to his adversary if it comes off.</p>

<p>Many players have an idea that at 40-0 or at 40-15
it pays to serve the second service at full speed, on the
ground that at such a score the risk is justifiable. This
surely is a mistake. If the server keeps to the game by
which he has gained such an advantage he will probably
win one stroke in the next two or three. But if he sees
fit to take such liberties as to serve twice at full speed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
he will probably find the score level before he knows it,
and his opponent playing with increasing confidence.</p>

<p>I should strongly advise a player to learn thoroughly
the reverse overhand service, not only that it is unusual
and effective, but because one looks to the left to serve
it. You can in this way serve overhand, no matter where
the sun may be. With the sun on the right the common
overhand service is nearly useless, because the danger of
looking at the sun is so great. You may get the service
over all right and then be quite unable to see the
return.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="f75">FIRST STROKE.</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">By</span> first stroke is meant the return of the service. I may
safely say that more depends on this stroke than on
any other. If the first stroke is good, the striker-out
should have a decided advantage; if bad, he is almost
at the server’s mercy. What the first stroke should be
depends on the service and on the skill of the opponent.
Off a very fast service it is difficult to make a good first
stroke, because the slightest mistake will be enough to
send the ball into the net or out of court. If, however,
the first stroke is made exactly right, it is more crushing
in proportion to the speed of the service. The server
has had to fix himself to give a very fast service, and no
time is left him to recover for the return. The difficulty
of a very severe return of a very fast service is so great
that it must be looked on as fortunate, even among good
players. It is always very hard to foresee in just what
place the service will pitch, and, therefore, the striker-out
cannot prepare himself for any particular stroke. He
must be ready to return the ball; that is the first point.
For the rest, he must return it as severely as he safely can,
and into that part of the court where it will most readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
go. By this I do not mean that the service should be
returned purposely into the middle of the court, but
every fast ball is more naturally returned in one direction
than in another, and all I advise is that a very fast
service should be returned into whatever part of the
court it is easiest to put it. If the first service comes
off and is very fast, it will almost always give the
advantage, and the striker-out must be content to yield
the position and to play for safety.</p>

<p>Very different is the case with the second service.
The server is no longer trying for an advantage, and
the striker-out can choose the way in which he will
begin the attack. The server will now probably be far
back in the court—about the middle of the base-line or
a little behind it—and the chances are that he will
succeed in returning the first stroke, no matter where it
may be placed. It would, therefore, require an unusually
severe stroke to finish the rest at once, and it is
running too great a risk to attempt such a stroke. The
ball should be played sharply down the side-line or
across the court to the farther side-line, so as to put the
server on the defensive at the start. Of this I shall
speak more fully in treating of the “game”; at present
I shall only try to explain what strokes there are to
use.</p>

<p>1.—The most common and, perhaps, the safest stroke
is to play the ball down the side-line into the corner,
especially when the service has been into the right court,
as this brings the return into the backhand corner, and
few players are as good back- as fore-handed.</p>

<p>2.—One can also return diagonally across the court
to the far corner. This stroke should be played very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
hard, for if made slowly there is a chance for an easy
return. Moreover, if time is given him, the server may
come forward and meet the ball in the middle of the
court and kill it by a sharp volley. For this reason it is
better not to play this stroke if the server is coming up,
but to play either Nos. 1 or 3.</p>

<p>3.—There is another stroke, and the most difficult of
all. It is to play the ball slowly across the court to the
farther side-line. The ball should strike the ground as
near to the net as possible, so that a player who is
coming forward cannot reach it before it has bounded
and passed on across the side-line. If made correctly,
there is no answer to the stroke, except a half-volley.
It is an essential part of the stroke that it should be
played very slowly, or else the ball must go out of
court.</p>

<p>4.—Sometimes, but very seldom, one has to lob the
first stroke; for instance, when the first service has been
very severe, and the server has followed it up close, one
may be unable to make a good stroke to one side of the
court, and, if so, it is best to lob.</p>

<p>Again, the server will at times follow up his second
service, and, if he gets very close, the safest stroke will
be a lob over his head into the back of the court.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.<br />

<span class="f75">THE STROKE.</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">By</span> stroke, I mean the motion with which a ball is
returned off the ground. Of course, all balls cannot be
played in the same way; that must depend on how they
come, and on the hardness of the ground. As a rule,
however, a player can choose in which of two ways he
will play the ball. He can take the ball at the top of
its bound, in which case the head of the racket is held a
little higher than the hand, and the racket itself is
nearly horizontal. The stroke is made with the forearm
and wrist, and the arm is straightened as the ball is
struck.</p>

<p>The other method is to let the ball fall till within a
foot or so of the ground, and then, so to speak, to lift it
over the net. The racket is held upright, with the head
a little back and the hand forward. The ball is taken
beside, and a little in front of, the right foot, and a short
step forward is made with the left. In striking, the
racket is raised, not from the shoulder, but from the
elbow, and the wrist is bent backward. The direction
of the ball is given by turning the wrist at the moment
of striking, and for this reason it is very difficult for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
one’s opponent to foresee where the ball will be put. I
should explain that the stroke is not meant to be a
“slam,” but a quiet, regular stroke, whose strength lies
less in its speed than in its accuracy, and in the difficulty
of foreseeing its direction.</p>

<p>Of the two strokes I much prefer the second one. It
gives one’s opponent more time to place himself, but, on
the other hand, one gains both in accuracy and severity
of stroke, and can also change the direction of the
ball at the last moment.</p>

<p>On a very hard ground the horizontal stroke is the
more common, because the ball rises so high that one
would have to go very far back in the court to play it
with a vertical racket, and in doing so would lose his
position. On a slow ground, the chance for the second
stroke occurs all the time.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="f75">THE VOLLEY.</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> become an adept at the game, the player must be able
to volley well; he must know how the stroke is made,
and he must be able to make it, no matter where the ball
may come—high or low, right or left, straight or dropping.
One common principle applies to all volleys, namely,
that the ball must not be allowed to hit the racket, but
the racket must hit the ball, and a distinct stroke should
be made. A step should always be taken with the
opposite foot, <i>i.e.</i>, with the left foot in a forehanded
stroke, and with the right in a backhanded one.</p>

<p>As an example, take the ordinary forehand volley at
about the height of the shoulder (a very common stroke).
The elbow should be away from the body and not down
by the side, the wrist a little bent upwards, and the head
of the racket above the hand. In striking, the weight
is thrown forward on to the left foot, which is brought out
with a good step in front of the right foot and a little
across it. There is no preliminary swing of the racket
backward. The head of the racket should be brought
forward on to the ball with a sharp bend of the wrist, and
the arm should be straightened to nearly its full length.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
The racket should not be checked suddenly after striking
the ball, but should swing well forward, and then by
an easy motion the head will come up into the left
hand, where the centre-piece should always be carried
between the strokes. The elbow, shoulder, and wrist
should all be left free, and not held stiff while the stroke
is made.</p>

<p>The backhand volley is made in much the same way.
The elbow should be raised and away from the body;
the head of the racket should be just over the left
shoulder, and the stroke should be made by stepping
forward with the right foot, straightening the forearm,
and bringing the head of the racket sharply forward by
bending the wrist. It is this turn of the wrist at the
last moment of the stroke that gives sharpness and
character to all volleys.</p>

<p>It is much easier to volley a ball at the height of the
shoulder back than forehanded, and it is worth while to
remember this fact when trying to pass a volleyer from
the back of the court.</p>

<p>These two volleys are used with the ball from four to
six feet from the ground, both in coming forward from
the back of the court, and, more often, when already
in position, and your opponent tries to pass you. Both
strokes are easy in themselves if the ball comes within
reach and if you can foresee on which side it is coming.
The real difficulty lies in getting into position for the
stroke, and not in the stroke itself.</p>

<p>A more difficult ball to volley is one that is only a
foot or so off the ground. Such a ball is best volleyed
forehanded, with a vertical racket. The hand comes out
directly in front of the body, and the stroke is made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
almost entirely by the wrist. There should be little or
no swing of the racket beforehand.</p>

<p>A ball a little higher, that is, between waist and knee,
cannot well be volleyed in the same way. One must
step to one side or the other to get room to return it,
and it is easier to play it backhanded. One should step
forward and bend well down to meet the ball and volley
it with the head of the racket a little above the hand.</p>

<p>A great deal of time is saved by these low volleys,
and one is sometimes caught while coming forward or
going back in a position when nothing else can be done.
It is a stroke that a player should learn to make as
well as possible, but it is not one that he should use
except to gain an advantage by saving time, or when he
can do nothing else.</p>

<p>We now come to a wholly different class of volleys,
namely, those of a dropping ball, as when a weak return
is made off a fast service, or more often when one player
is lobbing to drive his opponent back. In this class
comes the “Smash,” which is simply a volley made very
hard, with all the joints of the arm free, so that as soon
as the stroke is started all control of the racket is lost.
In a simple volley the joints are not held stiff, but one
retains control of the racket throughout the stroke; in
a smash one lets the racket go apparently at random.
It is not a stroke to play except when very close to the
net, and even then a more careful volley will usually be
sufficient, and far safer.</p>

<p>It is of this volley that I wish to speak, as the occasion
for it comes constantly. It must be made hard, it must
be placed, and its direction must not be shown till the
last moment. Take the most common case: you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
just in front of the service-line, your opponent lobs from
the back of the court and the ball does not go very far
beyond the service-line. How are you to make the
stroke? Of course the ball may come in front or on
either side, but it travels so slowly that you can usually
take it as you please, and it is best to do so forehanded.
You should stand with your feet slightly apart, and in
striking should take a short step forward, and a little
across with your left foot. The racket is held close to the
body with the left hand round the centre-piece till
the ball comes within reach. Then lift the racket
quietly and strike without any swing backward; but the
racket should follow the ball after the stroke, and not be
checked suddenly. The whole stroke, from the time
when the racket is lifted, should be made without any
pause. One often sees a player waiting for the ball with
his racket lifted; the effect is ridiculous, and, what is of
more importance, it is usually easy to tell where he
means to put the ball. The ball should be taken at
about the same height as in service, but decidedly more
in front, because it is nearer the net. The wrist
should be bent forward at the end of the stroke to bring
the head of the racket down on top of the ball.</p>

<p>Any lob that comes near the middle of the court
should be played forehanded, but when a ball is much
to the left of the central-line it is better to play it backhanded,
as it puts one too much out of position to get
on the other side of the ball. The stroke is played in the
same way as the forehanded one, except that the step
is made with the right foot and should be in front of the
left, but not across it.</p>

<p>The easiest place to put the ball is into the backhand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
corner or across to the farther side-line. Without
taking his eyes off the ball, the player can usually tell
about where his opponent is, and can place the stroke
accordingly. In all such volleys he should make up
his mind just where he means to put the ball before he
takes the step forward, and he should not change it even
if he sees that his intention is discovered.</p>

<p>No rule can be given for placing the volley, but in any
case the stroke should be severe enough to prevent the
next lob from being as good as the last. If you do not
gain a distinct advantage by the volley you are pretty
sure to be worse off next time. It is worth while to
take a good deal of risk in such a stroke, for the moment
that you begin to play a lob faintheartedly, you will be
passed or driven back in a stroke or two. One’s object
should be to kill the ball, if that be possible; if not, to
place it so as to get an easier stroke next time. If you
can do neither one nor the other, you had better not
volley the ball at all, but go back and play a defensive
game from the base-line. If you cannot attack you must
be ready to defend yourself, and the place to do that is
not in the middle of the court.</p>

<span class="f75">THE HALF-VOLLEY.</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> half-volley is the prettiest stroke in lawn tennis; it
often saves valuable time, and it helps one out of many
difficulties. There is only one remark more to be made
about it, and that is, never play it if you can possibly
avoid it. Unless played exactly right, it will give an
easy return, and will allow your opponent to gain the
advantage in position if he did not have it before. If
he did, it will probably give him a chance to “kill.”</p>

<p>The worst part of the stroke is that it is a very
fascinating one, and it is, therefore, played a great deal
too often, especially by young players.</p>

<p>The stroke consists in taking the ball just as it begins
to rise after striking the ground. It is simply a question
of timing the ball. The player cannot watch the ball
as he strikes it, and he must trust to his knowledge of
the place where the ball will come. It is best made with
the racket as nearly vertical as possible, with a short
step forward and with a “lift,” or upward motion of the
hand and forearm, at the end of the stroke.</p>

<p>To return balls that have already passed, one should
step across with the opposite foot, and, stooping very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
low, should half-volley with a snap of the wrist. In
such a case the racket is nearly horizontal. The great
point is to time the ball so as to get it exactly in the
middle of the racket.</p>

<p>My advice would be never to use a half-volley if the
ball could be returned in any other way, and, if compelled
to use it, to put pace on the ball and play it as
a fast stroke, and not as a slow one.</p>

<span class="f75">THE LOB.</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A lob</span> is a ball tossed in the air so that it shall fall far
back in the court, and shall be out of reach of a player
standing as far forward as the service-line.</p>

<p>The object is, of course, to make a stroke that cannot
be volleyed, except from the back of the court, where
the volley is seldom severe.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of lob—one with a low curve,
tossed just high enough to be out of reach, and the
other tossed very high in the air and meant to fall
almost vertically.</p>

<p>The first kind is used only when one’s opponent is
very far forward; in fact, almost up to the net. The
ball, being hit low, travels with some speed, and therefore
gives little time for a player to get back for it.</p>

<p>The other and more common kind of lob is used when
one is at a disadvantage, and is near the base-line or
quite out of court. The stroke is meant to gain time
for one thing, and, if possible, to drive a volleyer back.
The higher the ball goes the more perpendicularly it
will fall, and the harder it will be to volley.</p>

<p>It is much easier to lob forehanded, and the ball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
should be taken well in front of one, and to the right if
possible. Always lob toward the windward corner of
the court, but if there is little or no wind one should
choose the backhand corner.</p>

<p>Remember that a lob must go back nearly to the
base-line or it will give an easy stroke.</p>

<span class="f75">THE GAME.</span></h3>


<h4><i>Section I.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the preceding pages I have tried to give some idea
of the different strokes and of the manner in which they
are made. My object now is to take the game as a
whole, and to show in what cases the different strokes
should be used.</p>

<p>Before this can be done, we must speak of the different
styles of game that one meets. I do not refer to garden-party
lawn-tennis, but to the styles of the best match-players
only.</p>

<p>Seven or eight years ago no one thought of volleying
a ball that could be easily played off the ground. The
game consisted of carefully placed strokes of medium
pace, and the result was long, tedious rests of twenty,
forty, and even eighty returns. The first change in this
game was caused by the present champion, Mr. W.
Renshaw, who conceived the idea of going forward
almost to the net and volleying everything that he
could reach. This game, though brilliant, was not
wholly successful. The volleyer came too close to the net
and gave too easy a chance for the ball to go over his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
head, and probably, too, the volley was not then of
sufficient strength. The net was at that time four feet
high at the posts, and the angle at which a ball could
be volleyed was more restricted than now.</p>

<p>A year later Mr. Renshaw had changed his game in
an important point; he no longer came close up, but
volleyed from the service-line, or a little in front of it.
Complete success attended him, and his style of game
soon came to be received as the right one, and to be
generally played.</p>

<p>At that time the hitting from the back of the court
was slow according to modern ideas, and it was possible
to follow up and volley almost every ball without much
danger of being passed. The introduction of volleying
brought about a change in the back-play. There was
clearly no use in careful placing if the volleyer was given
time to get in front of the ball. It thus became necessary
to hit hard from the back of the court as well as to
place the return, and for the cases where this could not
be done, lobbing was brought into fashion.</p>

<p>The improvement in the back-play in its turn affected
the volleying game. With good placing and hard
hitting it was no longer possible to volley as many balls
as before, and, as a rule, the volleyer tried to make a
severe stroke, which should put his opponent at a disadvantage
before coming forward to volley.</p>

<p>It is in this state that we find the game now. It
seems a waste of time to discuss the old question of
“Volleying <i>v.</i> Back-play.” With the two games pure
and simple, and with no mixture of the two, I feel sure
that bad back-play will beat bad volleying, and that
good volleying will win against good back-play.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>One does not, however, see good players confine
themselves wholly to either game. As I said just now,
one cannot volley every ball, and one needs to be able to
make a severe stroke off the ground to get into position
to volley. This one can do only by skill in back-play.
Every well-known player of the present day believes
that both back-play and volleying are necessary for a
successful game, and the question now is not which to
use, but how to mix the two.</p>

<p>I believe that the superiority of the champion lies
mainly in the completeness of his game, in his ability
to play any kind of game that may be required. Mr.
Lawford no longer plays wholly from the back of the
court, but volleys a great deal, and very effectively too.
The only player who sticks completely to a back-game
is Mr. Chipp, and he has told me that he wishes that
he could volley. On the other hand, perhaps the most
bigoted volleyer in the world is myself, and I wish
most sincerely that I knew how to take a ball off the
ground.</p>

<p>It is not possible to lay down fixed rules for volleying
certain balls and letting others bound; were it so, all
players would play the same kind of game, and the difference
between them would be only in speed and accuracy.
Every player must judge for himself if he can
volley any particular ball more effectively than he can
play it off the ground.</p>

<p>Position is nearly everything in the present game, and
a player’s first object should be to get into his place;
once there, the chances are all in his favour. I do not
mean that the player nearest to the net has necessarily
the best of it, that must depend on the last stroke and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
on the place where his opponent is. If he comes up
after making a good stroke that has driven his opponent
back to the base-line, he has a great advantage, but if
his last stroke has been slow and has struck inside the
service-line, he is almost certain to be passed, if his
opponent does not make a mistake. I cannot dwell
enough on the fact that there is no use in volleying
unless a distinct advantage can be gained by it, or, at
the worst, that the back player must not have an easier
return than he had the time before. The moment that
a volleyer fails to make a severe or at least a well-placed
stroke, he is at a disadvantage, and would be better off
in the back of the court than where he is. It is seldom
that the two positions can balance, so to speak, and if a
volleyer is not distinctly up, he is pretty sure to go
down. Of course I do not mean that every ball that is
to be volleyed should be smashed; far from it, but I do
say that a volley should always be played hard on to
the base-line or across the court to the side-line. If
neither can be done, it is wrong to volley the ball at all.</p>

<p>Smashing I hold in great disrespect. As a rule, it is
a most unsafe stroke, and, when it can be played without
risk, a hard volley will generally be just as good. It is
a great satisfaction, both to the gallery and to the player
himself, to see a ball smashed through an umbrella or
a parasol, but it is an amusement that should be strictly
confined to exhibition matches.</p>

<p>Do not volley a very low ball if you can possibly help
it. For instance, one is coming forward, and meets a
slow return that has passed just over the net and is
dropping fast. Such a ball must be volleyed upwards
to cross the net, and it will therefore be impossible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
make a severe return, and the stroke itself is a difficult
one. Let such a ball bound, unless time is of unusual
value. Off the ground you will probably be able to
make a stroke that will give you a greater advantage
than if you had volleyed the ball instead of waiting.</p>

<p>A difficult but useful stroke is the volleying a ball near
the ground in the back part of the court. The player is
going back, or, more often, coming forward, and meets
the ball about half-way between the base-line and service-line.
If he can volley it fairly well he can follow up his
stroke, and gain the advantage in position which he
must have yielded in going back to take the ball off the
ground. One saves a great deal of time and of exertion
by such a volley, but it is a stroke that cannot be recommended
to any except a good volleyer.</p>

<p>One of the hardest balls to volley well is a lob. It is
easy enough to return it over the net, but, as I have been
trying to explain, there is little use in returning a ball
slowly into the middle of the court. I do not believe
that it is right to smash a fairly good lob, but I think
that it should be volleyed carefully, but still hard, far
back in the court, and, if possible, into a corner. There
is a long time to think as a lob drops, and many players
lose heart and decide to play for safety instead of trying
to kill the ball. As a matter of fact, it is safer to hit
fairly hard, and the moment that a player begins to hit
gently, for fear of putting the ball out of court, he
descends to a lower level as a player and diminishes his
own chance of success.</p>

<p>Speaking of returning lobs brings me to the question
of lobbing, as distinguished from low play. There is
undoubtedly a prejudice against lobbing, and a feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
that the low hitting makes the finer game. With this I
have nothing to do. I am simply looking for the best
game that one can play to win.</p>

<p>I believe firmly in low hard hitting down the lines or
across the court when one’s opponent is not quite in
position, as, for instance, when he is just coming up, or
has had a hard ball to play and has not yet recovered
himself. If there is a good chance to pass him, try to do
so by all means. If you cannot pass him but can make
a stroke that cannot be volleyed hard, in fact, can only
be stopped, try it, and the next stroke you can probably
pass him.</p>

<p>When, however, one is in the extreme back part of
the court, especially in the middle, the chance of passing
a good volleyer seems to me to be small. If one is in
a corner of the court, one has two strokes to choose from,
one down the side-line and the other across the court.
If the volleyer does not foresee which stroke will be
played, it is unlikely that he can do more than save the
ball. But, as just said, if he is in the middle of the
base-line, the angle at which the forward player can be
passed is very small, and the chances are that the ball
will be killed. In such a case I believe that it is good
play to lob. It is worth remembering this fact, that it
is harder for your opponent to pass you from the middle
of the base-line than from the corners of the court.
With a strong back-player against you, if you do not
get a chance to make a severe stroke into the corner,
and have got to return the ball slowly, you will be safer
if you return it to the middle of the base-line.</p>

<p>A great objection to lobbing is, that much depends
on the weather, and, if there is a strong wind, it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
be at a great disadvantage. Of course the wind will
affect low hitting as well, but not to the same degree.
When lobbing in a wind, always lob to the windward
corner, as, after all, the main point with a lob is to put
it anywhere in the back part of the court.</p>

<p>If you see that your opponent hesitates to hit a lob
hard, be ready to go in the moment the chance comes.
It usually is easy to tell if a player intends to stop a lob
instead of hitting it, and it is well worth while to take
some risk in running up to volley his return. He will
probably be too far forward in the court to return your
volley well, even if he gets it at all.</p>

<p>If your opponent clearly does not play lobs well,
lob whenever there is the slightest doubt of passing him,
especially if the sun is in his eyes. If on the other
hand he hits your lobs back hard into the corners, it is
better not to resort to them unless you can do nothing
else.</p>

<p>After saying so much in favour of lobbing, I must
add that, though I use the stroke a great deal myself, I
believe that a player should play low, if any chance is
given him to do so.</p>

<p>If you do play low, don’t play directly down the
middle of the court if your opponent is standing there.
It is much better to take a greater risk and play for the
side-lines. Remember that it is usually easier to pass
a volleyer on his forehand side. Remember, also, that
the easiest ball to volley is one hit low and hard, because
it comes in nearly a straight line. For this reason,
especially when a volleyer is coming forward, the most
difficult stroke that you can give him to volley is one
hit slowly enough to drop low before he can reach it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
If you can make him half-volley there will probably be
a chance to come in yourself.</p>

<p>It seems to me a mistake to hit as hard as one can
in trying to pass a volleyer. One succeeds more often
by accurate placing, and by concealing the direction of
the stroke till the last moment, than by its actual speed.
Of course, a fast stroke will give one’s opponent less
time to reach it, but the risk of the ball going into the
net or out of court is increased out of proportion to
the gain. It is surprising to see how easily a slow stroke
will pass a volleyer if he does not know on which side
it is coming. Combined speed and placing are perfection,
but the placing should be cultivated first, and the speed
increased as one improves.</p>


<h4><i>Section II.</i></h4>

<p>Let us now start as if beginning a game, and we will
take the routine points as they arise.</p>

<p>To serve: Stand nearly near the middle of the base-line,
a yard, or at the most two yards, from the centre.
In this position there is a larger angle, inside of which
the service can be placed, than if you stood at one end
of the base-line, and, moreover, you are in better position
to meet the first stroke.</p>

<p>If your first service is a fast one and is good, follow it
up if you can, and volley the return. But remember
that your volley must be severe enough to put your
opponent at a decided disadvantage, or he will probably
pass you with the next stroke.</p>

<p>If your first service is a fault, serve again more slowly.
You cannot put much speed into your second service,
but you can place it. Try to serve well back to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
service-line, and place it so that your opponent will
have to play it backhanded, or step to one side
before returning it. I do not mean that this placing
will produce any great results, but it will tend to
diminish the severity of the first stroke. As soon as
you have served, get back just outside of the court, or,
if the ground is low, stand on the base-line and a very
little to the left of the middle. The first stroke is more
often put into your backhand corner than anywhere
else; few players are quite as strong backhanded, and
can, therefore, afford less time in reaching the ball.</p>

<p>One word as to position. It is impossible to start
quickly if your feet are parallel. Stand with the heels
about a foot apart, the toes a little turned out, and every
joint slightly bent. The racket should be close to the
body, with the left hand round the centre-piece.</p>

<p>You are now on the defensive, and your opponent
will, no doubt, have come forward in front of the service-line.
In this position, unless the first stroke has been a
weak one, you can hardly hope to win the rest off your
first return; it is rather a time to play for safety. If
you can do so with a fair chance of success, try a fast
stroke down the side-line. If your opponent fails to
volley it well, you may hope to pass him next time. I
cannot advise trying to cross him on the first return; he
has had time to place himself, and if he is not deceived
about your stroke, he ought to kill it. If you see no
good chance to play down the lines, the best thing to
do is to lob. Lob as high as you safely can, so that
the ball shall drop almost vertically. Stay back outside
of the base-line and wait for your opponent to volley
your lob. If he hits it hard, probably you can do little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
else than lob again. If he simply stops it, you may be
able to go in and pass him; if not, lob again and go
up and volley his return. This is a winning stroke if
your opponent is afraid to let out at a lob.</p>

<p>Where you cannot do this there is nothing to do
except to lob until you can get a chance to make a low
stroke, off which you can get forward.</p>

<p>Don’t be too anxious to go forward, but if there is
any chance to do so, take it at once. Remember that
in lobbing you are on the defensive, and that you want
to reverse the positions the moment you can.</p>

<p>To return the service, stand completely out of court if
the ground is fast; if slow, stand on the base-line. It
is much better to be too far back than not far enough.
It is easy to come forward, and in coming forward you
naturally throw your weight into the stroke. When
going back it is very difficult to strike properly, because
you have to stop suddenly and throw your weight forward.
You are seldom steady on your feet when going
back, and in any case your weight is not on the ball.</p>

<p>Do not go too far to one side to receive the service,
for you may have to step in either direction. One can
actually reach farther backhanded than forehanded, but
few players can make the backhand stroke as well.</p>

<p>If the first service into the right-hand court is good,
the best working return is probably the one down the
side-line into the backhand corner. Follow the stroke
up at once, and take your place a yard or two in front
of the service-line.</p>

<p>Your opponent may try to cross you; he may play
down the side-line or he may lob. The hardest stroke
for you to return will be the one down your right side-line,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
but most players find it a difficult return to make,
and prefer to play across the court. If you see that the
ball is coming across, step forward two or three paces
and volley it hard backhanded down into the forehand
corner. If it comes down your side-line, do not come
farther up for it, but volley it back down the same side-line,
unless you are sure that you can play it across-court
before your opponent can reach it. All cross-court
strokes, unless very well made, are dangerous, as they
allow one’s opponent to come forward, and if he reaches
them he will have the best of the position.</p>

<p>Should your adversary lob, walk slowly back with
the ball and volley it quietly, but hard, into the back of
the court. Other things being equal, the backhand
corner is the best place into which to return a lob. If
your opponent lingers at all in the left-hand side of his
court, volley directly across to the forehand end of the
service-line.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid to hit a lob. There is really no half-way;
if you don’t make a good stroke off it, your
opponent will probably pass you.</p>

<p>In making these suggestions as to the strokes to play
in special cases, I am going as far as I see my way to
do in pure theory. For the rest, I can only call attention
to a few general principles.</p>

<p>Don’t stand still anywhere in the court. Keep in
motion all the time, for it is far easier to start quickly
if you do not “fix” yourself. The best example is a
marker in a tennis or racket court; he seldom is running,
and yet he is almost always where the ball comes. A
part of this is no doubt due to his judgment, but a great
deal comes from never standing quite still.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Don’t slam at a ball. It is very common to see
players “slog” at a fault or at a ball that has struck out
of court. It is a great mistake and puts you off your
stroke. A very common fault, if one is running for a
hard ball that can only just be reached, is to hit at it as
hard as one can. The chances are immensely against
such a stroke going over the net, while if the racket
were simply held in the way the ball would go back.</p>

<p>Don’t give up a rest till it is lost. Try to get the ball
back even if it seems to be useless. There is always a
chance that it may be missed.</p>

<p>Don’t be deceived by a ball coming over the net, or
striking inside the court when you do not expect it.
Take it for granted that every ball must be returned.</p>

<p>Never drop a ball short. It is a very tempting stroke,
and at times very effective, but one loses a great many
strokes in trying it. In almost every case the ball could
be killed as well by a hard stroke, and the danger of
putting it into the net would be much less. It is very
difficult to hit a ball so slowly that it will just go over
the net, and if it goes a little too far one’s opponent
comes forward to meet it, and can, as a rule, place it
wherever he pleases. I play the stroke at times, myself,
and each time vow that I will never try it again.</p>

<p>A necessary part of a good player is decision, and the
power of making up his mind quickly. Nowhere is this
so necessary as in following up the service. If you
mean to go up, don’t hesitate for an instant, take the
chances and go, and don’t stop half-way. Don’t go up a
little way and then wait to see what will happen; you
will not be far enough forward to volley, nor far enough
back to play off the ground. It puts you in a part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the court where you should never be, namely, somewhere
between the base-line and the service-line. The exact
position of this forbidden place depends on the speed
of the ground. It is at such a distance from the net
that the ball comes to you just above the ground, so
that you are forced to make a difficult volley or a half-volley.
You are not in position for volleying and would
be better off farther back.</p>

<p>It is very hard to say exactly where one should stand to
volley. The typical place seems to me to be a yard or
so in front of the service-line, and, if anything, nearer
still. The closer the player is to the net, the less ground
he has to cover. Imagine a player standing on the base-line,
and imagine a line drawn from him to each end of
the opposite service-line. These two lines represent the
two most widely-divergent strokes that he can make.
If now you stand on the service-line you have to cover
27 ft.; on the base-line 35 ft.; half-way from the service-line
to the net, 22 ft.; and at the net only 17 ft.
In reality, the amount of space you will have to cover
is less, as you cannot make a fast stroke without its going
beyond the service-line. Thus the nearer a player is
to the net the less space he leaves his opponent to place
the ball in, but, on the other hand, the quicker he himself
must be to judge and reach the ball. It is a great gain
if you can volley the ball while it is still above the level
of the net, as it can then be volleyed downward. If you
allow the ball to drop much, you have got to volley upwards
to get it over the net, and there can be little
severity in your stroke, which moreover itself is a
more difficult one to make. Again, the sooner you
meet the ball, the less time you give your opponent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
recover from his last stroke and to prepare himself for
the return. For myself, I am always ready to take a
good deal of risk in order to stand near enough to make
a severe volley. If one’s opponent lobs much it is
unsafe to go in close, as one may have to run back for
the ball.</p>

<p>In a word, it seems to me that each player must judge
for himself in what place he can return his adversary’s
strokes to the greatest advantage, and this place will not
be the same against different players. You can usually
tell if your opponent means to lob, and I believe that it is
right to go in closer whenever one is sure that he will
not lob, and then fall back again to be ready for any
stroke next time.</p>

<p>There is one more point to which I want to call
attention. Suppose that you have made a weak volley
into the middle of the court and are at the time well
forward. Your opponent can probably put the ball
about where he pleases. What should you do? Get
back by all means if you can, for that is better than
staying up with the chances against you. If you can’t
do that, stay and fight it out, but remember that there
is no use in standing still in the middle. Your opponent
can put it either side of you. Wait till he has made up
his mind, and then go to one side or the other. Even if
you have no idea to which side you ought to go, it is
still an even chance that you will choose the right one.
In such a case it is the only chance that you have, and
if your opponent sees you going the right way he may
miss his stroke in trying to change its direction.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_II_II" id="CHAPTER_II_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="f75">MATCH PLAY.</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Match</span> play is always a very different matter from
simple practice. The excitement and anxiety affect
nearly all players; some more, some less. The majority,
I fancy, play worse in a match, while a few players
need the interest of a match to make them play their
best.</p>

<p>Then the question of endurance comes in, which in
practice is of very little importance, as you can stop
playing when you feel tired. A match, moreover, is in
itself more exhausting, as you can seldom afford to
drop your game to rest yourself, and the anxiety tells
greatly on your wind. A player who often plays six
or seven hard sets in practice may feel utterly out of
breath in the first set of a match, mainly from excitement.
The more he plays the less he will notice
the difference between practice and matches.</p>

<p>A great difference, too, lies in the fact that a player,
being anxious, is afraid to play his game, and tries only
to get the ball back. This is a very great mistake, but
it is much easier to tell him to play as he usually does
than for him to do it. Almost the first advice that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
I should give to any one who was going into his first
match, “Try to play just as you would in practice.”
If he cannot win by playing his usual game, he will, as
a rule, play worse instead of better by changing it. It
may prove, of course, that you cannot win with your
usual style of play. In such a case, try something else
by all means, but don’t do so until your own game has
been fairly tried.</p>

<p>If you are winning, be still more careful to hold to
the same game. One often sees a player at forty-love
serve fast twice or try a slashing stroke or two. It was
not by such play that he reached forty-love. If he
keeps to his game he ought to win one stroke in the
next three, but who knows what may happen if he tries
experiments?</p>

<p>The same thing is done at four games-love, at five
games to one or two, or at any such score, and the
player who is ahead is often justly rewarded by losing
the set.</p>

<p>Another player will be tempted in the opposite way.
He gets a good lead, and, to make sure of the set, begins
to play a very cautious game. The moment he does so
he is playing a weaker game. His real game gave him
his lead, but that does not show that he can hold his
advantage unless he plays as well as he has been
playing.</p>

<p>I saw one of the great matches last year lost in just
this way—by a desire to make too sure. In conclusion
I can only say that each one should play the game that he
can play best, and let him have the courage to stick to
it, whether he is ahead or behind.</p>

<p>My object in speaking of match play is less to suggest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
any special game than to point out certain advantages
that are constantly thrown away.</p>

<p>First, as to the toss. A coin is better than a racket.
More rackets, I feel sure, come up rough than smooth.
If you win the toss, go into both sides of the court, and
observe carefully how the light comes, the wind, the
background, the ground itself, and the amount of room
round it. Do not forget that the sun will move a good
way during five sets, and it may be possible to get the
best side twice in succession.</p>

<p>When playing the best of five sets, take the best
court, unless there is some special reason against it. If
the worst court will be much worse than it is in half-an-hour,
it pays to take it first. One may win the first set
in it before it gets too bad, and should then have a
certainty of the second and fourth sets. If the first set
should be lost, the second and fourth sets should bring
the score level, and no harm would have been done.</p>

<p>If a player takes the best court first he is sure of
having it twice in a match, and he stands more chance
of winning three sets to love. If the court decides the
set, he will have the lead all through till the fifth set,
and even then will have it for the first game.</p>

<p>In matches that are the best of three sets you have
to take each court once, and, if there is a difference in
the light, I believe that it pays to take the worse court
first. You do not feel the light nearly as much then
as you do after changing from the better side, and your
opponent does not appreciate the advantage that he
has. If the light is so bad that you lose the first set,
you ought to be as sure as ever of winning the second.
The only exception is in playing against a young or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
fainthearted player, who will be so much encouraged by
winning the first set that he will be harder to beat the
second. It is a safe choice against any old match-player,
as he will understand the case perfectly.</p>

<p>With a wind blowing up and down the court, it pays
best to play the first set with the wind. One gets into
one’s stroke better in this way, and, on changing sides, it
is easier to hit harder than to keep a constant check on
one’s self to avoid hitting out of court.</p>

<p>In knocking up before a match, always take the court
with the sun in your eyes, so that, if you lose the toss,
you will be accustomed to the sun, and will not have to
change from good light to bad. If you win the toss,
you will feel the advantage of the light all the more.</p>

<p>It is now very common to change sides every game
of the whole match. Should you wish to do so, do not
forget to appeal before tossing, or else it can be done
in the odd set only.</p>

<p>If you fancy yourself to be a stronger player than
your opponent, it is better to change sides every game
of the match, or else he may win two sets with the help
of the better side, and then everything will depend on
the odd set.</p>

<p>If you change sides every game, and are really better
than he, you should be able to win every set, or, at least,
three sets out of four.</p>

<p>If your opponent is better than yourself, on no
account change sides if you can help it. Try to win
two sets in the good court, and trust to luck for the odd
one. There is always far more chance that the worse
player will win any particular set than that he will win
two in three or three in five if the conditions are equal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>In one word, if you are the better player, do all that
you can to exclude luck from the game, because, if there
is no luck for either side, you will probably win. If
luck is to come in, no one can say who will get the best
of it.</p>

<p>The next point to consider is the service. With
duffers the service is an advantage, because the striker-out
misses so many balls, or, at least, returns them
weakly. With good players, I believe the service to be
a decided disadvantage. On a good ground almost
every service can be returned. The first service, if fast,
seldom comes off; if of moderate speed, it can be returned
with ease. A second service should leave the
striker-out free to do what he chooses with it.</p>

<p>I should, therefore, always give my opponent the
service if I could, unless sides were to be changed every
game. In this case the service will always come from
one end, and if you lose the toss you can choose from
which end.</p>

<p>Against the sun and wind most services will be weak;
therefore, if you serve better than your opponent, put
the service with the sun and wind. If he serves
better than you, you can diminish his advantage by
putting the server in the worst court.</p>

<p>If you can serve the reverse overhand service, always
put the server against the wind and sun. This service
will twist more against the wind or going up hill, and
the ordinary service will suffer. Moreover, in serving it,
one looks to the left, and can often keep the sun out of
one’s eyes when one’s opponent will have to face it.</p>

<p>Should there be a slope in the court, a fast service
down hill will be unusually severe. If you are playing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
a weaker man, put the service up hill; if a stronger
serve down hill.</p>

<p>The present rule of changing sides at the end of every
game works rather absurdly in one way, as it is a disadvantage
to win the toss. It is seldom that a player
has not a decided preference for serving from one end
rather than from the other, and his opponent will probably
prefer the opposite. It is a small advantage to
have the better court for the first game, compared with
the arrangement of the service. If the winner of the toss
chooses the court, his opponent can make him serve or
serve himself, as he prefers to have the service come
from one end or the other. If the winner chooses to
serve he can be put in either court that his opponent
sees fit. If you are unlucky enough to win the toss, take
the service, if you want the service to come from the
worst court, and your opponent may prefer to let it be
so rather than to give you the best court. If you want
the service to come from the best court, make him serve
so that he shall have to choose the worst side to prevent
it.</p>

<p>A good instance of the value of the toss happened to
me last season. In a double match I lost the toss; my
opponents, after consulting, came to me, and offered me
the choice on the ground that it made no difference to
them. I naturally answered that they had won the toss,
and could choose what they liked, but that they must
choose something.</p>

<p>The whole matter is complicated by the question of
endurance. A five-set match will last two hours, and if
the players are evenly matched, condition will make a
great difference. What, then, is the best thing for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
player who is physically the weaker to do to diminish
his opponent’s advantage?</p>

<p>If there is some difference between the sides, but it is
still quite possible to win on either, I should advise the
weaker player to change sides every game, else he may
exhaust himself in trying to win on the worse side.
Besides, he is more likely to win three sets-love. Instead
of this, when the difference is distinct, but not very
great, he may take the worst court and try to win the
first set in it while he is still fresh, and then play for the
second and fourth sets on the good side. If he is rather
a better player than his opponent, he will stand a good
chance to win the first set, and he should then have a
great advantage, if he only takes care of himself. If he
is rather the worse player as well as the weaker, he had
better play for two sets on the better side and for the
fifth, for he probably cannot win on the worst side, and
will injure his chance for the last set if he tries to.</p>

<p>If the difference between the sides is very great and
the players about equal, I think that the weaker man
should not change sides every game if he can help it.
Here, too, his best chance is to win two sets easily and
hope for the fifth. If he changes sides, the games may
be won alternately by the help of the court, and the sets
may be very long.</p>

<p>Of course, the interest of the more enduring player is
exactly the opposite. He should prolong the match as
much as possible, and when on the worse side should
play up all that he can, so as to tire his adversary, even
if he cannot win.</p>

<p>A great deal of judgment is requisite to decide when
to let a set go. One’s adversary is seldom as easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
to beat after he has won a set as he was before, and I
think that “chucking” a set is a luxury that should be
indulged in very seldom, and only when playing up
would spoil one’s chance in the other sets.</p>

<p>A player should never play slackly because he fancies
the set won. Every game that he loses encourages his
opponent, and also makes it harder for himself to get
back to his old game. There is no score at which a set
is safe till it is won.</p>

<p>On the other hand, never give up a match till it is lost.
I have seen the score two sets to love and five games
to two, and the player who was ahead lost the match.
It is always worth while to try for one more game. Try
to learn to play up the whole time, unless it is absolutely
necessary to ease off to save your wind.</p>

<p>I wish to call particular attention to the fact that it
is a great mistake to attempt to return the service till
you are sure that you are ready. Your opponent will
often serve as soon as your face is turned towards him,
and there is a strong temptation to return the ball. In
such a case you are not really ready. You should take
time enough to get to your place, and get your feet
under you and your eyes fixed on your opponent. If
he serves too soon, let the ball go by untouched, and do
the same thing on the second service, and on every other
service for which you are not perfectly ready.</p>

<p>When you go in to volley, and you see the ball
coming to you, make up your mind in time where you
mean to put it. I have often lost a stroke by being too
slow in deciding, and having to think where the ball
should go at the time that I ought to have been
playing it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Often when a player is about to volley a ball to kill it,
he sees his opponent going to the spot where he intends
to put the ball. Ought he to change his mind and put
it elsewhere? I think certainly not. It is better to trust
to the original stroke; if he changes he will probably
make a weak stroke or miss altogether. This does not
apply to cases where he sees his opponent going to one
side or the other before he has made up his mind. He
should then, of course, play to the unprotected side.</p>

<p>Watch your opponent playing beforehand if you can.
Few players have no weak points, and it may be of great
service to you to know his.</p>

<p>Be careful to get thoroughly warm before you go into
court. Without this precaution, one is very apt to lose the
first game or two, which perhaps one can ill spare. Every
man must judge for himself how much warming-up he
needs, for he must not carry it to the extent of tiring
himself at all before a long match.</p>

<p>Do not neglect to find out who is to umpire for you,
and if you think him incompetent, object to him before the
match. It is sufficient if his manner is annoying to you,
as you need all your attention for the game.</p>

<p>You will be constantly umpired out of games, and
even matches, and the annoyance is much less if you
feel that you have done all that was in your power by
having good men to umpire.</p>

<p>Learn in a match to say nothing about the decisions,
and to think of them as little as possible, else one bad
decision may lose you many strokes.</p>

<p>Be careful about the minor details of the game. See
that your racket does not want a new string and that
there is no nail at the end of the handle that may hurt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
your hand. Have a second racket ready in case of
accidents, and have it as like the first as possible.</p>

<p>Look to your shoes, and see that there are enough
points in them, and that they are not clogged up with
dirt.</p>

<p>If you want something to drink in a match, brandy
with a little water in it is the best thing; soda is too
bulky. A slice of lemon is very pleasant in hot weather.</p>

<p>If the handle of your racket slips a little, lemon-juice
rubbed on it makes it easier to hold. With an octagonal
handle, I believe that any slipping of the racket arises
from some fault in the way in which it is held.</p>

<p>As to eating and drinking, I believe in living just as
one is in the habit of doing, using stimulants and
luxuries in moderation.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important matter is sleep. Going
to bed at two and sleeping till ten is by no means the
same thing as getting eight hours sleep earlier in the
night. It has come to be a well-recognised fact that
one cannot go to a ball and play matches the next day.</p>

<span class="f75">THE DOUBLE GAME.</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">I do</span> not intend to discuss different ways of playing the
double game, such as one man at the net and the other
back, &amp;c., because at the present time there is only one
style of game among good players.</p>

<p>Both men should stand a yard or two yards in front
of the service-line, and each near enough to his own side-line
to prevent his being passed on that side. I do
not mean that each player should have a spot in the
court where he should stand, for then it would be easy
to put the ball between the two players or outside of
either of them.</p>

<p>When waiting for the return of the service, the player
on that side should keep well out to defend his own
side-line, and his partner (the server) should come up
near enough to the middle-line to prevent the ball from
passing between them. This principle applies more or
less to all cases where the return is to come from a spot
near a side-line. When the ball is in the middle of the
court, each player of the other side should stand about
the middle of his own court, and, as in the single game,
should fall back a little if he expects a lob, and come
forward a little to meet a low ball.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>One great difference between the single and double
games is that in the double the court is more fully
covered, as there are only eighteen feet for each player
to defend, instead of twenty-seven. The result is that
it is much more difficult to place a ball where it cannot
be reached, and one has to hit harder to kill than
in the single game.</p>

<p>It is hard to say just where the server should stand to
serve, but it should not be so near the middle as in the
single game, because he has more space to cover on one
side and none on the other. Perhaps the best place is
about the middle of his own half of the base-line, but it
is rather a matter of taste.</p>

<p>His partner should stand on the other side of the
court just in front of the service-line, and near enough
to the side-line to make it impossible for the ball to pass
him on that side. There is hardly anything that discourages
a player so much as to see his partner leave
his side-line unprotected.</p>

<p>The server should follow up his service at once, so as
to volley the return. If he serves a fault, let him
serve again very slowly and up in the air, so as to
give himself time to get to the service-line and into
position before the return can reach him. If he serves
a ball of medium pace he will probably have to volley
while on the run, and the return may strike the ground
in front of him so that he will have to half-volley.</p>

<p>The striker-out takes the service in about the same
position as in the single game. His partner should
stand a little behind the service-line, and near the
middle of his court, so as to have a chance of saving
the ball should the striker-out make a weak return of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the service. If the service is well returned, he should
run forward into his place, which is about a yard in front
of the service-line, and near enough to his own side-line
to protect it. If the first service is a fault, he should go
forward at once, as his partner should have no trouble
in dealing with the second service, and he himself needs
to be in his own place for the opponent’s first return.</p>

<p>Where should the return of the service be placed? A
fast service should always be placed across court, because
the server’s partner is standing in front of the striker-out,
and has a much better chance to make a severe volley
than the server who is running up. A second service
can be played in several ways. The server has no doubt
followed up his service, and if he has served slowly
enough he will be up to the service-line, and both sides
of the court will be covered. Still, one can often put
the ball between the two players so that neither can get
it easily, and I fancy this stroke most for a return of the
second service. You sometimes, of course, get a chance
to play down the side-line, because your opponent on that
side has come in too far toward the middle of the court.</p>

<p>If there seems to be no opening, one may be able to
make a slow stroke that will drop enough to force a half-volley.
If such a stroke is too difficult, the best thing
to do is to hit directly at one of the opponents, for a
ball that comes directly at one’s body is seldom as easy
to volley as a ball a little to one side.</p>

<p>You can also try playing to the side of the court so as
to force one of your opponents out to the side-line, and
thus make a gap between him and his partner.</p>

<p>A very pretty stroke off the second service is to play
the ball very slowly directly across the court almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
parallel with the net. The ball should strike just inside
the side-line. This can be done only when the service
bounds high and not far back in the court. It is an
essential part of the stroke that it should be made
slowly, or the ball must go out of court. The server
has not time to get forward before the ball touches
the ground, and if he returns it at all it will usually
be by a half-volley.</p>

<p>When all four players are in position for volleying,
one is often puzzled where to put the ball, as there seems
to be no place left vacant for it. The same principles
apply here as in the return of the second service, except
that the server has had time to place himself. You must
work for an opening by driving one of your opponents
out of place, or you must try to make one of them half-volley,
which may give a chance for a smash, or must
simply keep on returning the balls and trust that a
mistake will give you the opportunity to kill which he
cannot make for yourself.</p>

<p>Against weaker players one can well afford to take no
risks and wait for a chance, but against better players
this will not prove a winning game, and it will pay to
try to make an opening better than to wait for one.</p>

<p>A player should try to keep far enough forward to
volley before the ball can drop, for if he is forced to
half-volley he is almost sure to give his opponent a
chance to kill.</p>

<p>One can smash more safely in the double game, because
the court is larger. It is also necessary to volley
harder to kill than in the single game, as the court is
more fully covered.</p>

<p>Should you make a weak stroke from the back of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
court, as, for instance, a short lob, both you and your
partner should fall back to or behind the base-line and
try to save the ball.</p>

<p>The great difficulty of the double game is to divide
the play properly between the two partners. The question
is not of letting each one play the same number of
balls, but simply of allowing each to take those which
he can play to the greatest advantage.</p>

<p>With both men in position for volleying, each player
of course takes the balls on his own side; the trouble is
simply about those between them. The simplest rule
and the best is to let the partner who played the last
ball play the next. He knows best where the return
will probably come, and his eye is in for it. I fully
believe in the teaching of the Champion, that a player
should be allowed to finish a rest if he can. That does
not mean that he is to rush all over the court, but that
he is to take all the doubtful balls. A player feels the
wisdom of this rule when he has been watching his
partner play several strokes in succession, and is suddenly
called on to take a fast volley himself. He does
not know where nor when it is coming nearly as well as
if he had played the ball before it.</p>

<p>This shows us another principle of double play.
Keep hammering at one man, if he is at a disadvantage,
as thus you can probably gain something with each
stroke. If, however, he is on equal terms with you,
after he has played several strokes hit hard at his
partner, who is often unprepared.</p>

<p>It is well to have some understanding between the
two partners as to which shall take doubtful balls,
where the principle before explained does not apply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
If one player is better than his partner it is right to
allow him to play all such balls.</p>

<p>If the sun is across the court, one player can see such
balls much more clearly than the other, and this should
be recognised and arranged for beforehand.</p>

<p>The two players are seldom at the same distance
from the net, and if there is a chance to smash a ball
the more forward player should take it, if the ball comes
near him. With high balls, the player to whom they
come forehanded is usually the one who should take
them, and that, of course, is the one on the left side.</p>

<p>On the other hand, with low diagonal strokes, it is
best to let the player towards whom the ball is crossing
the court, play it. It is usually within the other player’s
reach, but he will probably find it a difficult stroke, and
will gain nothing by taking it himself. For instance, if
the service is returned from the right court into the
right court on the other side, the left-hand player can
usually reach and return it, but he will do better to leave
it for his partner who is coming forward to meet it.
Cases of this kind occur constantly and lead to a great
deal of trouble.</p>

<p>This brings me to the practice called “Poaching,”
<i>i.e.</i>, taking balls that should be played by one’s partner.</p>

<p>You may often see a ball which you feel sure that you
can play better than your partner, although it is not on
your own side of the court. My advice would always be—“Don’t
touch such a ball!” To reach it you must go
across the court, and your own side is left unprotected,
so that if you fail to kill the ball you probably lose the
rest. Moreover, if your partner is as good a player as
yourself, he ought to be left to play the ball; if he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
not good, it is a mistake to let him see that you do not
trust him. It will cost you more strokes than you will
gain by taking his balls.</p>

<p>The only time that it seems right to me to cross is
when there has been a very weak return made, and you
feel sure that you can kill the ball, and at the same time
feel sure that your partner is too far back to reach it in
time to do the same thing.</p>

<p>With this exception, never go in front of your partner;
it destroys his confidence, and he never knows when he
will be called upon to play.</p>

<p>There are a great many balls between the two players
which one of them can certainly play better than the
other, and yet the wrong one will often take them. In
such cases it is simply a mistake; it is not poaching in
the real sense of the word. One often takes such balls
instinctively, and often, too, one is a bit farther forward
than one’s partner, and cannot tell if it is safe to leave the
balls to him.</p>

<p>There is certainly a lot of poaching done, and a
sufficient reason for avoiding it is that it really does not
pay.</p>

<p>On the other hand there is a lot of nonsense talked
about poaching, where it is simply jealousy between the
two players.</p>

<p>When a player cannot forgive his partner for taking a
ball that he should have left to him, especially where it
is simply a mistake of judgment, he is not himself a
fit partner to play with.</p>

<p>Another great mistake is to find fault with your
partner’s play. It never does any good, and it either
makes him lose his temper or discourages him. If he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
misses an easy stroke, remember that you might have
done the same, and if he makes a good one give him
the credit of it.</p>

<p>If your partner is going to play a stroke, keep away
a little and give him room. If he hears you coming up
behind he may think that you mean to take the ball,
and, in any case, hearing you so near may take off his
attention.</p>

<p>Be careful to play up as well as you can all through a
double match. You may be able to pull yourself together
after some slack play, but you may have got
your partner so discouraged that he cannot play at all,
so that you will lose the match and it will be nobody’s
fault but your own.</p>

<p>This applies also in cases where your partner lacks
endurance. Remember that he may be of little assistance
to you at the end of a long match, and you should
never by any carelessness of your own, give your opponents
a chance to prolong the game.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IV_II" id="CHAPTER_IV_II"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="f75">LADIES’ AND GENTLEMEN’S DOUBLES.</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> seems fitting to say something of these matches since
most tournaments give prizes for them, but it is very
hard to give any definite advice as to the best method
of playing them. It depends so much on one’s partner,
and on the strength of one’s adversaries.</p>

<p>It may be taken for granted that the lady is not as
strong a player as her partner, and the game therefore
consists in protecting your own partner and attacking
your adversary’s.</p>

<p>As to the choice of court and service, the same principles
apply as in doubles, except that the service is
worth taking, as one expects to gain an advantage when
serving to the lady.</p>

<p>It is perhaps best to put your partner in the left
court, as the service will not come so hard to her there
as in the other court. Besides, you have more chance
of winning the first stroke if you play it yourself, and it
is encouraging to have the lead.</p>

<p>The way in which the game is usually played is for the
lady to stand on the base-line and nearly at one end of it,
so that she can easily reach any balls on that side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
court. The man looks after the rest of the court, and
does any volleying that is to be done. The lady’s part
of the work is simple enough in theory; she takes all
the strokes in her part of the court, and also saves, as
far as she can, any balls which her partner fails to
reach.</p>

<p>What the man should do is harder to say. My own
idea is about as follows:</p>

<p>If the service comes to the man, he should return it
hard to the lady opposite, and then follow up to volley
her return. In coming forward he should not take the
middle of the court, but should keep towards his own
side, so that there shall be little danger of her passing
him down his own side-line, and also so that his partner
may know which side of the court she is to cover.</p>

<p>Supposing that the ball is returned to his partner, the
man should not stay forward, or he will leave her to play
the whole game against both the adversaries, but he
should go back to her assistance till he gets a chance
to come forward again.</p>

<p>She, in her turn, has to get the ball away from
the man on the opposite side, who has no doubt come
forward; and, if she fails, she and her partner must try
to save the stroke as best they can. If she succeeds in
passing the man opposite, there probably will be a chance
for her partner to go forward and volley.</p>

<p>If the man is serving, he should follow up a severe
service if he possibly can. For the return of a second
service it is better for him to stay back at or about the
middle of the base-line, for he can play most strokes
better than his partner, and if he goes forward on a weak
service the ball will probably come to her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>With both players back in the court, the lady at the
corner and the man at the middle of the base-line, he
should leave her to play all the balls that come to her.
If he takes his partner’s balls, as many do, he must
leave his side of the court wholly unprotected, and he is
unlikely to gain enough to justify the risk.</p>

<p>If the ball comes to the man, his natural return is to
the corner where the lady is standing. If her partner
has come forward to volley there should be little difficulty
in passing him in a double court, and if he gets
out into the middle it may pay to try to pass him on
the side away from his partner.</p>

<p>It is so easy to pass a volleyer in a 36 ft. court, that
there is not much use in coming forward unless the last
stroke has been to the lady, or has been unusually
severe.</p>

<p>A man should take more risk in volleying than in
the double game, because his partner is unable to do
her share of the play, and he can at times go across
the court for an easy ball. He should not, however, do
this often. He leaves the space behind him unprotected,
and is apt to lessen his partner’s confidence.</p>

<p>In cases where he does go across, there should be a
distinct understanding as to the place in which his
partner should stay. She can either stay where she is,
while he goes back to his own side after the stroke, or
she can cross and he stay on her side. The latter would,
I believe, be the better plan for partners who played
often together. The lady has more time to get across
the court because she can start as soon as she sees that
her partner means to cross himself. In spite of this
advantage, I should prefer with most partners to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the lady always keep her own side and the man go back
to his, after crossing for a stroke.</p>

<p>If there is no arrangement, the man may be afraid to
leave any ball after he has once gone across, because he
cannot spare time to see where his partner is.</p>

<p>The amount of risk that should be taken to reach a
ball to volley varies with the strength of the adversaries
and with the chance of winning the match. If your
partner is not as good as the lady opposite, the match
must be lost unless you can make up for her weakness.
Again, if the man against you is one of the great
volleyers, the ball must be kept away from him at any
risk. If you let the ball go back to your partner he
will get more chances than you can afford to give him.
In such a case I feel sure that it is right to go across to
volley on the least opportunity.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if your partner is really good,
don’t be afraid to trust her; give her plenty of room
and don’t worry her. If she is better than the lady
opposite, you should play a safe game. Cover your
own side and she will win, unless the man against you is
an unusually good player.</p>

<p>A very good example took place in some scratch
pairs last summer. A very good player drew a lady
who could not hit a ball over the net. Against him was
a good middle-class player who had one of the best
partners that he could have. If the man would have
stayed quiet, this pair would certainly have won. Instead
of that, he kept getting into the middle of the court,
only to be passed down his own side-line.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_V_II" id="CHAPTER_V_II"></a>CHAPTER V.<br />

<span class="f75">UMPIRES AND UMPIRING.</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the chapter on match play, I have already spoken
of umpires. It is a subject that is always leading to
trouble, and a great deal of the trouble is unnecessary.</p>

<p>We all know how hard it is to umpire, and that an
umpire gets little thanks if he makes no mistakes, and
a great deal of blame if he is wrong. You will often be
asked to umpire, especially if you umpire well, and I
think that you owe it to your friends to umpire if you
can.</p>

<p>The great secret is attention. Watch the ball the
whole time. Do not watch a line, for if the ball crosses it
suddenly you will not know on which side of the line
it struck the ground. If you follow the ball only, you
will see where it strikes, and can then tell on which
side of the line.</p>

<p>Do not call “play,” nor “good,” nor anything else, unless
the ball is out, and then call sharply and loud enough
to make it impossible for the players not to hear. If
you are appealed to in the middle of a rest and are
unable to decide, call “play it out,” and at the end of
the rest you can give your decision if one is necessary.</p>

<p>Do not call until the ball has touched the ground, and
then call as quickly as possible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Remember that an umpire is an unfortunate necessity,
and his first object should be to make himself as little
conspicuous as possible, and to annoy the players as
little as he can. What the players want is an umpire
who will attend to the game and will give an honest
decision as quickly and distinctly as possible. They
do not want any fancy umpiring done at their expense.</p>

<p>About the worst umpire that there can be is one who
is trying to show off his umpiring. I believe myself
that players are as a class the best umpires. They are
more used to watching the ball, and will, therefore, see
it more correctly. Besides, they understand better
what the players look for in an umpire.</p>

<p>It is your duty to keep the net at the right height,
and you should arrange it before play begins, and from
time to time afterwards, but don’t get down to look at
it in the middle of a game, unless it is absolutely necessary.
Look to see that the inside posts are in place, if
any are needed, and that they are not there for a double
game.</p>

<p>Enforce the rules strictly. It is not for you to discuss
them during a match, but simply to take them as
they stand. The moment that you relax them you
have no guide left. Be careful to find out beforehand
how many sets are to be played, and if they are vantage
sets or not. In case of any question arising about the
rules, send at once for the referee.</p>

<p>No matter at what height you stand, it is impossible to
see the farther side-line properly; and the same is true
in a smaller degree of the base-lines. It is nearly
impossible to call foot faults and to watch the service-line
too. You, therefore, need at least three line umpires.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
If you cannot get men whom you can trust, it is
better to umpire the base-lines yourself. It is a mistake
to let a man take the side-line and one of the base-lines
too. He will have to stand away from both lines, and
in such a place he cannot see the base-line as well as
you can yourself, and he cannot umpire the side-line
really well.</p>

<p>If a line umpire cannot decide a stroke on his own
line—as when a player comes between him and the ball,
or for any other reason—give your own decision, if you
are sure that you could see the stroke; if not, direct it
to be played again.</p>

<p>If the same thing happens on one of the lines that
you are taking yourself, you can appeal to one of the
line umpires, if he is in a place where he could see the
ball. On no account appeal to the gallery, for you are
certain to get both decisions.</p>

<p>If one of the players in a case of doubt tells you that
he lost the stroke, you should take his word for it, as he
is almost certainly right. You have no right to ask him,
and he is under no obligation to say anything, but if, of
his own accord, he gives the stroke, I can see no reason
why it should be played again.</p>

<p>If the players agree, their decision should certainly
be taken.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VI_II" id="CHAPTER_VI_II"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="f75">ODDS.</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Odds</span> are of two kinds—“given” and “owed.” When
odds are given, one player starts at love and his opponent
at fifteen, thirty, &amp;c. If odds are owed, one player is
love and the other behind scratch, so that he must make
one or more strokes before his score reaches love.
There is one other difference between the two kinds of
odds. With given odds, the larger odds are taken in
the even-numbered games, and, with owed odds, in the
odd-numbered games. The object is to distribute the
odds as evenly as possible through the different games
in cases where odds are both owed and given.</p>

<p>For instance, suppose A. owes B. half-fifteen and
gives him half-fifteen also. In the first game A. starts
at owe fifteen and B. at love; in the second game A. is
love and B. fifteen. Were it not for this provision the
first games would start at love-all and the next at owe
fifteen-fifteen.</p>

<p>Handicaps are now so general that something may
well be said of the game to play when giving or taking
large odds. If a player is receiving large odds, he must
remember that his opponent is probably a much better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
player than himself. If, then, he plays a cautious game
and tries mainly not to make mistakes, his opponent
will win nearly every stroke. The receiver of odds
ought to play as bold a game as possible. He should
hit hard and take every chance of making a stroke that
cannot be returned. Let him give the same odds to
some weaker player, and he will soon find how difficult
it is to give them if his opponent plays a fast game.
Against a player who hits hard and takes the chances
one is apt to make more mistakes than one can afford.</p>

<p>The reverse is true if a player is giving large odds.
He cannot afford to play as free a game as he would if
playing level. If he can make any particular stroke
that will win the rest twice in three times, he will win
easily against an equal, but if he is giving very large
odds he cannot afford to lose even one stroke in three.
In such cases the better player can afford to take no
risks whatever, and must play wholly for safety. If the
odds are very small, he should play the same game
that he would when playing level, and between these
two extremes his own judgment must guide him in
deciding what style of game to play.</p>

<p>There is little to say about odds in themselves, as it
is settled by law how they shall be taken; thus fifteen
is one stroke given at the beginning of every game of a
set, and no judgment can make it anything else. There
is, however, one important exception, the bisque.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VII_II" id="CHAPTER_VII_II"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<span class="f75">BISQUE.</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A bisque</span> is one stroke given in each set of a match,
either by itself or to increase or diminish other odds.
In other words, a player to whom a bisque is given can
at any time in the set add one stroke to his score simply
by claiming it. The only restrictions are that a bisque
cannot be taken after serving a fault or during a rest.
A bisque can be taken after one’s opponent has served
a fault. The explanation is very simple. It is not intended
that a player should attempt to give a very
difficult service, which would give him an advantage if it
should come off, and then, when it has failed, take his
bisque. On the other hand, it has not been thought
necessary to forbid him to take his bisque after his
opponent has served a fault, because in this case
nothing can be gained by waiting till the first service
has failed.</p>

<p>The value of a bisque must always vary as the chance
to take it to the best advantage comes or does not come.
In a very large number of matches, winning a particular
stroke would make all the difference in the world. In
other matches, by no means one-sided, there is no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
turning-point where a bisque is of much value. But if
the value of a bisque varies according to chance, it
varies a great deal more according to the knowledge and
skill of the player who takes it. When, then, should a
bisque be taken?</p>

<blockquote><p>
1. To make three, four, or five games love.<br />
2. To make three, four, or five games to one.<br />
3. To make four or five games to two.<br />
4. To make five games to three.<br />
5. Sometimes to make four games to three or five games to four.<br />
6. Sometimes to make five games all.<br />
7. Sometimes to make three or four games to five.<br />
8. Sometimes to make deuce at four games to five.<br />
9. Always to make game and set.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>I will now try to give the reasons for taking a bisque
in each of the above cases.</p>

<p>1. Three games love is a winning score. Two games
to one is a level one. Four games to one is about three
games more (practically) than three to two. So in a
still greater degree is there a difference between five
games to one and four games to two. In each of these
cases, winning the game will give a commanding lead,
and therefore it is right to take the bisque to make sure
of it.</p>

<p>The same reasoning applies to Cases 2, 3, and 4.</p>

<p>5. In changing sides with a distinct difference between
the sides, and with the score of games level, it is always
right to take a bisque to make game on the worse side.
On the other hand, it is a mistake to take it on the
better side, unless winning the game will make a very
great difference in the score. For instance, I should
always take a bisque to make four games to three on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the worse side, but never on the better, for I should feel
that there was little chance for the set if I could not
win on the better side without my bisque. The same
principle applies, though in a smaller degree, to the
service. If the server has been losing nearly every
game, it would be quite right to take a bisque to make
five games to four or four games to three on one’s service,
or on one’s opponent’s service if the server has been
winning.</p>

<p>6. To make five games all. This is a very hard case
to decide, especially in an advantage set. It is simply
a matter of judgment. If the chances are against one’s
winning at five all, with the bisque gone, it is certainly
better not to take it, and to run the risk of losing the
set at six to four.</p>

<p>7. In these cases the question is not of getting an
advantage in the set, but of taking the best chance of
saving a losing set. The question again is, whether one
thinks that one can win at three or four to five; if not,
one had better keep the bisque, and trust to luck to save
one more game without it.</p>

<p>8. In this case, one stroke will lose the set, and unless
there is good reason to expect to win that stroke the
bisque should be taken. As a rule, it is wrong to take
a bisque to make deuce, but in this case something
must be done and done at once.</p>

<p>9. This rule simply means—don’t forget the bisque.
There have been a great many matches lost because a
player has forgotten to take the set when it was won.</p>

<p>As said above, it is seldom right to take a bisque to
make deuce, because at deuce the giver of odds will
probably win, and the bisque will have been wasted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
The probability, of course, varies with the difference
between the two players. Thus, if receiving thirty and
a bisque, it would be folly for the worse player to take
his bisque to make deuce; if giving thirty for a bisque,
the bisque should not be taken to make game. In both
these cases deuce should mean a certainty for the
better player.</p>

<p>Where a bisque is given with small odds, as at half-fifteen
and a bisque, the difference between the two
players is not so marked, and the bisque may be taken
to make deuce or game as occasion demands.</p>

<p>All that has been said is meant to apply to cases
where a bisque is given alone or to increase other odds,
as it is not now the custom in lawn-tennis to give a
bisque to diminish other odds. Should this be done,
the bisque should be taken to make deuce, and not
game.</p>

<p>It is well to remember that there is a moral effect in
a bisque. Few men play up with as much confidence
with a bisque hanging over them as they do when it is
gone, and for this reason a bisque should not be taken
early in a set except to secure a commanding lead. It
should never be taken in the first two games.</p>

<p>There ought to be no need to explain that there
can be no use in taking a bisque at forty-love or at
forty-fifteen. The bisque will make game just as well
at forty-thirty, and if the game can be won without it
so much the better. Moreover, no good can come of
taking a bisque at deuce; there is quite time enough
at advantage for either player. There is another point
too often overlooked. There is no object in taking a
bisque unless there is a reasonable prospect of winning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the set after the bisque is gone. With the score at
five games-love, a bisque should not be taken to make
one game to five, because at that score there is no real
chance for the set. The only hope is to win two or
three games with the bisque still in. This may not be
possible to do, but it is the right thing to try for.</p>

<p>It is very common to see a player who is losing take
a bisque or two bisques almost at random, from a morbid
fear of never taking them at all. In this way he
adds a game or two to his score, but he forgets that it
is sets, and not games, that win matches. It is far
better to risk losing the set at six-love than to give up
a chance of winning it by taking a bisque for the sake
of saving one game. In such cases the best chance is
to keep the bisque in, and if the set does go wrong,
and the bisque is never taken, the player can console
himself with the thought that he has taken all the
chances in his favour, and could do no more.</p>

<p>With two bisques given, one of them can be taken a
little more freely than if it were the only one; but even
then it is almost always wrong to take it in the first two
games. One may often be taken to make deuce at a
critical time, and I should myself always take the first
one to make three games to five.</p>

<p>To take a bisque well a player must make up his
mind how much he can expect to do after the bisque is
gone. If he does not see his way to winning, it is
always justifiable to reserve the bisque for a better
chance later. Thus, if a player thinks that the odds given
him are too small, he is quite right to run a good deal of
risk rather than take a bisque early in the set.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Before concluding, it seems in place to speak of the
value of a bisque as compared with other odds, that is,
how many equal fifteen. I believe that about six bisques
have been calculated to be the equivalent of fifteen, but
I cannot help thinking that four would be nearer right
than six in actual play. It seems to me impossible that
the number can be determined exactly, because the
practical value of a bisque must vary, and because the
moral effect cannot be gauged. The average number of
games to a set is about nine where advantage sets are
not played; therefore fifteen equals nine strokes on the
average, one given in each game. In how many games
of the nine is that stroke actually of value? I do not
know; but there are always a number of games which
are hollow for one side or the other. In one case the
stroke given is useless, and in the other it would probably
not have been needed. Let us suppose that
fifteen represents the difference between two players,
and that they play level. Will the weaker player win
any games? I fancy that he will win two or even three
games, and he wants a sufficient number of bisques to
win three or four other games. Let us suppose that he
wins two games level. I think that there will be at
least two other games that can be won by a bisque
each. Should this be the case, the score could not be
worse than five games to four against him, and two
bisques still in—by no means an uneven set.</p>

<p>For myself, I should never hesitate between five
bisques and fifteen, and I think that I should take four
if I could not get five. My own feeling is that the right
number is just over four.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>I should say, in conclusion, that I am very ignorant
of the mathematical calculations which bear on the
matter, and I offer these opinions as the result of
experience in actual play, and from watching matches
where bisques were given.</p>

<span class="f75">CASES AND DECISIONS.</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following Cases and Decisions are intended to
meet questions often asked at tournaments; and also to
cover points apparently not provided for in the laws.
They have been prepared with the advice and assistance
of Messrs. W. and E. Renshaw, B. C. Evelegh, N. L.
Jackson, and R. D. Sears, to whom the author returns
his thanks:—</p>

<p>I. A player standing outside the court volleys the
ball or catches it in his hand, and claims the stroke
because the ball was certainly going out of court.</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—He loses the stroke. It makes no difference
where he was standing. The return is presumed
good until it strikes the ground outside of the court.</p>

<p>II. A player is struck by the ball served before it has
touched the ground, he being outside of the service
court. How does it count?</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—The player struck loses the stroke. The
service is presumably good until it strikes in the wrong
court. A player cannot take the decision upon himself
by stopping the ball. If it is going to be a fault he has
only to get out of the way.</p>

<p>III. The service is delivered before the striker-out is
ready. He tries to return it and fails. Is he entitled to
have it played over again?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—No. If he attempts to return the service
he is deemed ready.</p>

<p>IV. The striker-out calls “Not ready” for a second
service. The ball strikes beyond the service-line, and
the striker-out claims that the fact that he was not
ready makes no difference since a fault cannot be
returned, and therefore that two faults have been served.</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—The second service goes for nothing. A
player cannot call “Not ready,” and then have the
service count, or not, as suits his interests.</p>

<p>V. A ball having been played over the net, bounds
back into the court from which it came. The player
reaches over the net and plays it before it falls. Has he
a right to do so?</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—Yes, provided he does not touch the net.
He has a right to play the ball at any time from the
moment it crosses the net into his court until it touches
the ground a second time.</p>

<p>VI. A ball is played into the net; the player on the
other side, thinking that the ball is coming over, strikes
at it and hits the net. Who loses the stroke?</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—It is simply a question of fact for the
umpire to decide. If the player touched the net while
the ball was still in play he loses the stroke.</p>

<p>VII. Can a player follow a ball over the net with his
racket, provided that he hits the ball on his own side of
the net?</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—Yes. The only restrictions are, that he
shall not volley the ball until it has crossed the net, and
that he shall not touch the net or any of its supports.</p>

<p>VIII. A player’s racket slips out of his hand and
flies into the net. Does he lose the stroke for hitting
the net?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—Yes, if the ball be still in play. It does
not matter if the racket be in a player’s hand or not.</p>

<p>IX. A player’s racket leaves his hand, but meets the
ball and returns it over the net. Is it a good return?</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—Yes. There is no law requiring a racket
to be in a player’s hand when the ball is returned. It
would unquestionably be a good return if the racket
were held against the ground by a player’s feet, and the
ball bounded back off of it.</p>

<p>X. A single match is played with a double net and
inside posts. A player touches the net beyond the
inside posts, and claims that he does not lose the stroke,
because there should be no net more than 3 ft. outside of
the court.</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—He loses the stroke. The net where he
touched it is part of the supports of the net. He might,
perhaps, have objected to the arrangement of the net
before the match.</p>

<p>XI. A player returns the ball, and finding that he
cannot stop himself before reaching the net, jumps over
it. Is it a good return?</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—Law 5 requires that “the players shall
stand on opposite sides of the net,” and therefore the
player invading his opponent’s court loses the stroke.</p>

<p>XII. A ball passes outside the post of the net and
strikes in court. Is it a good return?</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—Yes. The laws have been changed to
make it a good return.</p>

<p>XIII. A ball going out of court hits the top of the
post of the net, and bounds into the opposite court.</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—It is a good return. (N.B.—It has occurred
with the regular championship posts.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>XIV. The service or the ball in play strikes a ball
lying in the court. Can it be returned?</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—Yes; if it be clear to the umpire that the
right ball is returned; otherwise the stroke should be
called a let.</p>

<p>XV. The server claims that the striker-out must
stand in the court. Is this necessary?</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—No. The striker-out can stand wherever
he pleases on his own side of the net.</p>

<p>XVI. A bystander gets in the way of a player who
fails to return the ball. May he then claim a let?</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—Yes, if in the umpire’s opinion he was
prevented by an accident beyond his control. For
instance, if the ropes or the seats are allowed to be so
near to the court that a player is interfered with by
them, the stroke should not be played again, because
the ropes and seats form part of the arrangements of
the ground. If, however, a spectator passes in front of
those seats, or places a chair nearer than the original
line, and so interferes with a player, the stroke should
be played again.</p>

<p>XVII. A player is interfered with as above, and the
umpire directs the stroke to be played again. The
server had previously served a fault. He claims the
right to two services.</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—The fault stands. A let does not annul a
previous fault.</p>

<p>XVIII. A return hits the umpire or his chair or stand;
the player claims that the ball was going into court.</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—Unless the umpire can say that the ball
was in his opinion not going into court, he should call
a let.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>XIX. A player receiving fifteen serves from the left
court, his opponent claims a fault.</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—It is a fault. The service starts from the
right court under all circumstances.</p>

<p>XX.—At fifteen all, the server by mistake serves
from the left court; he wins the stroke and serves again
(a fault). The mistake is then discovered. Is he entitled
to the previous stroke? From which court should he
serve next?</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—The previous stroke stands. A fault cannot
be claimed after the next service, good or not, is
delivered. The next service should be from the left
court, the score being thirty-fifteen, and the server has
served one fault.</p>

<p>XXI.—A player serves from the wrong court, he
loses the stroke, and then claims that it was a fault.</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—If the stroke was played in his first service
it is simply a fault, but if he serves twice into the wrong
court he has served two faults, and lost the stroke.</p>

<p>XXII.—The partner of the player whose turn it is to
serve, serves and wins the game. The error is not
discovered until the first service of the next game
has been delivered.</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—A new game having been begun, the previous
game stands.</p>

<p>XXIII.—The same case as above, except that the
error is discovered after two or three strokes have been
played.</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—Any score made before the last service is
delivered stands—<i>i.e.</i>, the last stroke does not stand
unless another service (fault or not) has been delivered.
The proper server will then serve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>XXIV.—With the score at thirty-forty, the server takes
a bisque, and then serves from the right court. His
opponent claims a fault.</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—It is a fault. The service must come alternately
from the right and left courts.</p>

<p>XXV.—A player takes a bisque after the server has
served a fault. Which court does the server next serve
from?</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—From the same court.</p>

<p>XXVI.—The score is five games all, and the umpire
directs the players to play an advantage set. The
advantage game has been won when it is discovered
that no advantage sets are to be played. What is to
be done?</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—The set is won at the eleventh game. It
is no part of the umpire’s duty to decide on the conditions
of the matches.</p>

<p>XXVII.—A player serves. He hears the umpire call,
but cannot hear what he says. He knows that the only
two things that the umpire should call are “fault” and “let,”
and that in neither case can the ball be in play. He
therefore does not return it, only to find that the umpire
has called play. Has he any redress?</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—No.</p>

<p>XXVIII.—The umpire calls “fault” and then instantly
changes and says “play.” The striker-out fails to return
the ball, and he claims that he was prevented by the
umpire, and also that the umpire cannot change his
decision.</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—The umpire should call a let and the service
be taken again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>XXIX.—A ball drops near a line, the player appeals,
and the umpire calls “play.” The player misunderstands
the call, and lets the ball fall. He then claims to have
the stroke played again.</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—The stroke stands.</p>

<p>XXX.—A ball strikes the ground close to a line, the
scorer scores the stroke against the striker. On appeal
to the linesman, the latter decides that the ball was not
out. Which decision stands?</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—The scorer has no right to consider a ball
out until the linesman has called to that effect; therefore
the decision of the latter must be accepted. The
decision of a linesman affecting his own line is final.</p>

<p>XXXI.—A return strikes the cord running along the
bottom of the net and bounds over. Is it a good return?</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—Yes.</p>

<p>XXXII.—During play a ball is thrown into the court
and the ball in play strikes it, or a player steps on it.
May a let be claimed?</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—Yes.</p>

<p>XXXIII.—The server’s first service strikes his partner.
Does he lose the stroke or is it a fault?</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—He loses the stroke.</p>

<p>XXXIV.—A player serves a fault, and it is then discovered
that it is his partner’s service. Does the fault
stand?</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—No. No other service having been delivered,
the fault does not stand.</p>

<p>XXXV.—If the umpire is appealed to, and directs
the wrong partner to serve and the mistake is discovered
in the middle of the game, what should be done?</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—See decisions XX to XXIII. The player
who should have served continues the service.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>XXXVI.—In a four-handed competition one player
does not to appear in time to play, and his partner
claims to be allowed to play single-handed against the
opposing pair. May he do so?</p>

<p><i>Decision.</i>—No.</p>

<p class="mt4">To meet the requirements
of those players who desire
a bat similar to the No. 1,
we have introduced a Racket
which we shall designate the
“Ich Dien.” It is made of rent frames, thoroughly
seasoned, but unselected. The gut is transparent
white, English manufacture, and of excellent quality. The
“Ich Dien” is a useful and sightly bat, and made on the
most approved lines from the recent decisions of experts.
Octagon handle and oval head.</p>

<p class="mt4">The “Handy” Press will be found an improvement,
being much lighter in weight and more portable. Being
in parts, it can be packed into a very small compass. One
screw only need be taken out to remove the Racket.

term the water wheel, is made with hollow teeth or buckets; these carry the composition
(with which the box is to be supplied), and deposit it upon a platform, fixed between the
front, or marking wheel, and the water wheel; thence it is transferred to the front wheel,
which transmits it to the lawn.</p>

<p>The “No. 1” is the distinctive mark of
a Racket which we with great confidence
introduce to the general public for the first
time this season. It is made on the precise
lines of Rackets made by us for many of the
most prominent and successful experts of the
game of Lawn-Tennis, and has been so
highly spoken of by them that a very large
demand has already been created for it, and
we have every reason to feel certain that it will be
one of our most popular productions.</p>

<p>The “Lawford” is a new shape this season, and
is specially adapted for a rapid game. The head is
a modification and combination of the round and
square head, and being smaller in size, the handle
is necessarily longer. In this Racket a somewhat
lesser playing surface is produced; at the same time
a very rigid tension is obtained in the stringing giving
a quicker return of the ball, at the same it is not so well adapted for screwing
purposes. It is made with the octagon handle.

<p>These Poles are ornamental and effective; they are made of cast iron,
and finished in black japan paint, picked out with gold. For utility they
have no equal. By means of a lever and weight the Net is maintained at a
uniform height, and with the exact tension necessary; the action of the
weather has no effect on the uprights, which never become loose. The Poles
can be readily removed without disturbing the ground fixings. The ground
fixing does not loosen, and is less injurious to the lawn than any other Poles.
Wherever supplied they have been highly approved.—<cite>Vide Press.</cite></p>

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
